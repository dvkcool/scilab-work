# GSoC 2018 - Scilab
This repository contains the shell script which automates the process of installing dependencies and compiling scilab.

## Task 1
In this section I will be working on a script that installs and downloads all the dependencies including fink for Mac OS X >= 10.9
Currently I am working on Mac OS X 10.13

## Task 2
If the dependencies are installed, the script should detect automatically and continue to compile Scilab

## Found a Bug ?
